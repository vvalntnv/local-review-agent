# Local Review Agent
This is an attempt to create a simple coding review agent

## Goal of the project
The goal is not to create a comperhansive agent-building library. This is a prototype of an application that serves as a learning-pad.
The prototype is just a way for me to learn how to build agents from scratch, using the ollama API.

## FUTURE
no future for this project, **THIS IS A PROTOTYPE**. Do not expect the cleanest code, nor the best practices applied here
