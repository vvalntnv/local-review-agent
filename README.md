# Local Review Agent
This is an attempt to create a simple coding review agent

## Goal of the project
The goal is not to create a comperhansive agent-building library. This is a prototype of an application that serves as a learning-pad.
The prototype is just a way for me to learn how to build agents from scratch, using the ollama API.

## FUTURE
no future for this project, **THIS IS A PROTOTYPE**. Do not expect the cleanest code, nor the best practices applied here

## Leasons learned
AI is dumb. Especially Local AI. The program has to do a lot of work to chunk somewhat ambiguous user requst in order 
for the AI to understand it. In a next project, I would probably go with a Planner agent (one that plans the tasks for the review agent) and then a review agent, that will follow the planned tasks by the planner agent and execute the tasks. Or something along those lines

The code you are seeing in this repo is nowhere near perfect but its a start. The journey without LangChain or other types of libraries for doing AI agents is ON!
